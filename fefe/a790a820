[l] Wisst ihr, was wir lange nicht mehr hatten? Einen Stack Buffer Overflow in Schlangenoel!Money quote:This kind of design choice is common practice in the anti-virus industry. They all like to parse and process files in a relaxed fashion. In particular, they are inclined to accept various kinds of (partially) invalid files.The reason for this is essentially that there exist many different variants of consumer software processing popular file formats (such as rar, zip or 7z). The aim of relaxed file parsing and processing is to cover as many implementations as possible, and to avoid the scenario in which the anti-virus product is dismissing a file as invalid that then is successfully processed by some consumer software.Man koennte fast sagen: Antiviren haben eine erhoehte Angriffsoberflaeche! Haette uns doch nur jemand gewarnt!!1! (Danke, Robert)
