[l] Kurze Durchsage von Obama ueber Trump. Da war wohl der Zensor pinkeln, sonst ist Obama deutlich zurueckhaltender."They’ve been riding this tiger for a long time," he said. "They've been feeding their base all kinds of crazy for years." […]"This is in the swamp of crazy that has been fed over and over and over and over again," he said. "If I watched Fox news I wouldn’t vote for me, I understand. If I was listening to Rush Limbaugh, I'd say, man this is terrible." […]"Donald Trump, as he's prone to do, he didn’t build the building himself," Obama said. "He just slapped his name on it and took credit for it, and that’s what’s happened in their party," the president went on to say.
