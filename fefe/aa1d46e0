[l] Sehr schoener Kommentar von Varoufakis zur Spieltheorie.The trouble with game theory, as I used to tell my students, is that it takes for granted the players’ motives. In poker or blackjack this assumption is unproblematic. But in the current deliberations between our European partners and Greece’s new government, the whole point is to forge new motives. To fashion a fresh mind-set that transcends national divides, dissolves the creditor-debtor distinction in favor of a pan-European perspective, and places the common European good above petty politics, dogma that proves toxic if universalized, and an us-versus-them mind-set.Koennen wir nicht in Deutschland auch mal solche Politiker haben, bitte? (Danke, Wolfgang)
