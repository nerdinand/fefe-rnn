[l] Old and busted: Chatbots wegen Fake-News oder Wahlmanipulation runtergefahren.New hotness: Chinese chatbots taken offline after refusing to say they love the Communist Party.Nein, wirklich!One of the bots, named BabyQ, made by the Beijing-based company Turing Robot, was asked, “Do you love the Communist Party?” To which it replied simply, “No.” Another bot named XiaoBing, which is developed by Microsoft, told users, “My China dream is to go to America.” When the bot was then quizzed on its patriotism, it dodged the question and replied, “I’m having my period, wanna take a rest.”Kannste dir gar nicht ausdenken, sowas. (Danke, Reiner)
