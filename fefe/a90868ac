[l] Die gute Nachricht: Hillary Clinton benutzte einen Passwort-Manager, damit sie starke Passwoerter benutzen kann, ohne sie zu vergessen.Die schlechte Nachricht: Es handelte sich um eine Person namens Monica Hanley.CLINTON did not know her email login information, as HANLEY would generally change the information in CLINTON's BlackBerry when necessary so CLINTON's email would automatically populate. When CLINTON's password required changing, HANLEY would choose a new password, update CLINTON's BlackBerry with the change, and notify ABEDIN, COOPER and BRYAN PAGLIANO. HANLEY had CLINTON's email logon information and password, so she could check CLINTON's email if needed. On occasion, CLINTON would ask HANLEY to research an old email that CLINTON was unable to pull up on her BlackBerry. In order to respond said request, HANLEY would open up CLINTON's email account remotely from a computer and print the document for CLINTON. HANLEY assumed ABEDIN also accessed CLINTON's email account on occasion.Post Privacy!
