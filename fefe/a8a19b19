[l] Die Russen konkretisieren ihre Vorwuerfe gegen den Clan Erdogan."Turkey is the main consumer of the oil stolen from its rightful owners, Syria and Iraq. According to information we've received, the senior political leadership of the country - President Erdogan and his family - are involved in this criminal business," said Deputy Defence Minister Anatoly Antonov."Maybe I'm being too blunt, but one can only entrust control over this thieving business to one's closest associates.""In the West, no one has asked questions about the fact that the Turkish president's son heads one of the biggest energy companies, or that his son-in-law has been appointed energy minister. What a marvelous family business!""The cynicism of the Turkish leadership knows no limits. Look what they're doing. They went into someone else's country, they are robbing it without compunction," Antonov said.Und, typisch russisch, lassen sie es ihren Vize-Verteidigungsminister sagen, nicht mal den richtigen Verteidigungsminister. Als wollten sie zeigen, dass die Faktenlage so offensichtlich ist, dass man nicht die Zeit des Verteidigungsministers in Anspruch nehmen muss dafuer. :-)
