[l] Kurze Durchsage von James Clapper:The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscowâ€”the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.James Clapper, wir erinnern uns, ist der Mann mit dem topologisch bemerkenswert klar abgegrenztem Spontan-Alzheimer. Also WENN jemand zu irgendwelchen Geheimdienstfragen vertrauenswuerdig ist, DANN JA WOHL CLAPPER!!1!
