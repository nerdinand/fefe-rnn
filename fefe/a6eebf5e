[l] Google Project Zero hat sich mal den Apple-Kernel angeguckt. Es ging aus, wie man das erwarten wuerde.This post discusses a design issue at the core of the XNU kernel which powers iOS and MacOS. Apple have shipped two iterations of mitigations followed yesterday by a large refactor in MacOS 10.12.1/iOS 10.1. Weâ€™ll look at the bugs, how they can be exploited to escape sandboxes and escalate privileges, and how we can defeat each of the mitigations. Every step is accompanied by a working exploit.
