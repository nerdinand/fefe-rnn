[l] Twitter Cuts Off Fusion Spy Centers’ Access to Social Media Surveillance Tool. Wenn ihr noch nie den Begriff "Fusion Center" gehoert habt:This Twitter and Dataminr announcement applies to all seventy-seven fusion centers (six in California alone) that are currently operating in states across the country. These domestic spy centers—local-state-federal partnerships that aim to collect and analyze vast amounts of information to connect the dots about “threats”—have a history of sweeping in constitutionally protected political, religious, and artistic activity. These spy centers also gather information about innocent people deemed “suspicious” by law enforcement – people like ACLU client Tariq Razak, a “male of Middle Eastern” descent who was waiting in a train station for his mother to use the restroom.
