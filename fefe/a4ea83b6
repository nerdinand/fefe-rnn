[l] Bug des Tages: User Build bricht, weil man(1) um 0:30 "gimme gimme gimme" ausgibt.Und die Erklaerung, wieso man das tut, ist absolut grossartig:The maintainer of man is a good friend of mine, and one day six years ago I jokingly said to him that if you invoke man after midnight it should print "gimme gimme gimme", because of the Abba song called "Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight":https://twitter.com/marnanel/status/132280557190119424Well, he did actually put it in, a few people were amused to discover it, and we mostly forgot about it until today.Wie geil!
