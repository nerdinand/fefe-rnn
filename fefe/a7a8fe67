[l] Benutzt hier jemand exiv2 fuer EXIF-Parsing?When I previously tried to
report bugs in exiv2 found via fuzzing the upstream author made it
clear to me that he has little interest in fixing those issues and
doesn't consider his software suitable to parse defect files (which
basically means it's unsuitable for untrusted input).Weil Das Bugtracking-System so schnarchlahm ist, hier ein paar Money Quotes:Returning to Hanno's request that we say that Exiv2 is "not suitable for untrusted input". I will not do that. The default (for all open source software) is that the user must determine suitability for his/her purposes. We do not claim that Exiv2 is safe for all files. I doubt if we could ever make such a claim even if we pepper our code with checks for malicious images. I don't believe in 2016 that it is possible to guarantee the safety and reliability of any software.UndI know nothing about hacking and exploiting buffer overflows. Perhaps we need more caution about them. This is a mind-boggling issue. The code to defend our image read/write code could be larger than the current library.Wie schlimm ist es? So schlimm:Are you aware of the term "fuzzing"? I believe this is the art of creating illegal files to put software under stress. I am aware that libexiv2 can be exploited in this way, however I have never had time to work on this topic.
