[l] Das Gender Gap konnte daher kommen, dass Frauen schlicht nicht so viel Wert auf berufliche Befoerderung und Macht legen.compared to men, women have a higher number of life goals, place less importance on power-related goals, associate more negative outcomes (e.g., time constraints and tradeoffs) with high-power positions, perceive power as less desirable, and are less likely to take advantage of opportunities for professional advancement. Women view high-level positions as equally attainable as men do, but less desirable.Na da machen wir doch erstmal eine Quote!
