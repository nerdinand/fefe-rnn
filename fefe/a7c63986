[l] Toller Bericht ueber "Lawful Interception" in den Niederlanden. Hier ist der geilste Teil:There was at least one security incident in Driebergen: De Volkskrant describes that during a meeting with FBI and FSB, a Russian official came to a member of the Dutch police team, pointed at someone from the FBI and said "he is copying your data". An investigator went looking and saw that indeed the American had a thumb drive in a police laptop and was copying Dutch information.Wait, what?! (Danke, Rop)
