[l] Kurze Durchsage von Trump:From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms, and trains terrorists, militias, and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region. For decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror.Das sagte er anlaesslich des 350-Milliarden-Waffenverkaufs der USA an die Saudis. 2014 klang das noch anders. Oh, und 2016 auch. Und er hat sogar schon gehoert, dass die Saudis hinter 9/11 stecken.Aber die Punchline:As ever, for Trump, it is always, above all else, about the bottom line â€” his bottom line. The Saudi-bashing Trump sold an entire floor of the Trump World Tower to the Saudis for $4.5 million in 2001. And would it surprise you to discover that Trump also registered eight companies tied to hotel interests in Saudi Arabia in the midst of his Saudi-bashing presidential campaign?
