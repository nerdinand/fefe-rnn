[l] Kurze Durchsage des CEO von Volkswagen anlaesslich einer Automesse in den USA:Matthias Mueller: Frankly spoken, it was a technical problem. We made a default, we had a … not the right interpretation of the American law. And we had some targets for our technical engineers, and they solved this problem and reached targets with some software solutions which haven't been compatible to the American law. That is the thing. And the other question you mentioned — it was an ethical problem? I cannot understand why you say that.Das ist besonders lustig, wenn man den Vortrag auf dem 32c3 gesehen hat.
