[l] Bei Facebook ist ein peinliches Memo geleaked:“We connect people. Period. That’s why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in. The work we will likely have to do in China some day. All of it,” VP Andrew “Boz” Bosworth wrote.“So we connect more people,” he wrote in another section of the memo. “That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs someone a life by exposing someone to bullies.“Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.”Ach komm, was zaehlen schon ein paar Menschenleben! Hier geht es um Wichtigeres! Um Wachstum fuer Facebook!
