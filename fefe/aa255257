[l] Lesenswerter Artikel ueber Ferguson und allgemein die Schwarzenbezirke in den USA.  Money Quote:The tension has been exacerbated by an increasing financial dependence on traffic fines by some municipalities in the region and by a pattern in some Missouri cities, including Ferguson, of the police pulling over black motorists at a greater rate than whites. In 2013, Ferguson, with a population of about 21,000, had the highest number of arrest warrants — often served by municipal courts when someone fails to appear in court — in the state relative to its size: 1,500 warrants per 1,000 people.Wie krass ist DAS denn?! (Danke, Peter)
