[l] Lacher des Tages: Britischer Terrorist kommt aus Syrien zurueck, geht lieber sieben Jahre in England in den Knast. Begruendung:'U need to get used to the cold water and no electricity. Everyday use cold water, u will probably get your first shower when u get to your mudhafa [annex]. The house u stay in before the muaskar [training camp]. It's tough bro lol, A LOT of patience is required [sic].'Start eating small amounts of food to get used to it, because u will be sharing your food as soon as u arrive. Bland food btw lol, inshallah it will be better when u get to mudhafa. Also u need to decide where u wana get placed. Alhamdulillah. I chose Halab [Aleppo]. We're placed in Menbej, small town, no action, just normal life alhamdulillah [sic].'Und ordentliches Bier gibt es hier auch nicht!1!!
