[l] Die Perspektive des Deep State in den USA auf Trump. Sie finden, die edlen und missverstandenen USA seien bereits im Krieg mit den fiesen, subversiven Russen, und insbesondere dass sich in den Nato-Osterweiterungs-Laendern niemand Illusionen macht, die USA wuerden sie im Zweifelsfall verteidigen, wenn Russland einmarschiert. Besonders toll finde ich diese steile These hier:To understand the shift underway in the world, and to stop being outmaneuvered, we first need to see the Russian state for what it really is. Twenty-five years ago, the Soviet Union collapsed. This freed the Russian security state from its last constraints. In 1991, there were around 800,000 official KGB agents in Russia. They spent a decade reorganizing themselves into the newly-minted FSB, expanding and absorbing other instruments of power, including criminal networks, other security services, economic interests, and parts of the political elite. They rejected the liberal, democratic Russia that President Boris Yeltsin was trying to build.Spaeter, ueber Surkov, haben sie aber noch diese wirklich treffende Formulierung:Third, information warfare is not about creating an alternate truth, but eroding our basic ability to distinguish truth at all. It is not “propaganda” as we’ve come to think of it, but the less obvious techniques known in Russia as “active measures” and “reflexive control”. Both are designed to make us, the targets, act against our own best interests.
