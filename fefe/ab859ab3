[l] Bug des Tages: Bei den EU-Servern von League of Legends fiel der Spectator Mode aus. Grund:A few days ago the total number of games played on the EUW server shard surpassed 2,147,483,648 games. (In case you went cross-eyed for a second, that’s just north of two billion games.) Unfortunately for our beleaguered spectator, that number also happens to be the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing.In other words, during the design of the spectator feature, our developers never anticipated the Game ID counter going that high on a single platform. EUW happens to be Riot’s largest shard globally - if one were posting this article in Twitch chat, the abbreviation might be “EUW > NA” - and surpassing that 2^31 digit threshold shot the lights out in EUW’s spectator mode.
