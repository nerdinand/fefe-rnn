[l] Das Council of Europe sagt, das Tuerkei-Referendum sei keine gerechte Wahl gewesen.“The referendum took place in a political environment in which fundamental freedoms essential to a genuinely democratic process were curtailed under the state of emergency, and the two sides did not have equal opportunities to make their case to the voters,” said Tana de Zulueta, Head of the ODIHR limited election observation mission. “Our monitoring showed the ‘Yes’ campaign dominated the media coverage and this, along with restrictions on the media, the arrests of journalists and the closure of media outlets, reduced voters’ access to a plurality of views.”Ich finde ja sehr geil, wie die hier was von plurality of views faseln, waehrend sie daheim unter dem Banner der Bekaempfung von Fake News und Hate Speech die Pluralitaet bekaempfen.
