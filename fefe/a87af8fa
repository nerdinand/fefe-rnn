[l] In Kalifornien tritt seit ein paar Tagen massiv Erdgas aus einem unterirdischen Reservoir aus.SoCal Gas said the only solution lies in relief wells being drilled to intercept and plug the damaged well.The company is paying to relocate and house residents and pets sickened by fumes that health officials and independent experts say can cause headaches, nosebleeds, nausea and other short-term ailments but pose no long-term health risks.
