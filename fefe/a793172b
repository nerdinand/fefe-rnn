[l] Es gibt jetzt in einem Buch Details dazu, wieso Trump den Manafort gefeuert hat. Es ging um einen New York Times-Artikel, der erzaehlte, dass Trumps Wahlkampfteam Interviews im Fernsehen machen muessen, damit Trump ihnen zuhoert. Das fand Trump nicht so toll.When everybody was assembled, Trump reportedly shouted at Manafort, "How can anybody allow an article that says your campaign is all f---ed up?""You think you've gotta go on TV to talk to me? You treat me like a baby!" Trump added, according to Green's account of the meeting."Am I like a baby to you? I sit there like a little baby and watch TV and you talk to me? Am I a f---ing baby, Paul?" Trump reportedly continued.The room then "fell silent," according to the book.Aaaawkward!
