[l] Mikko Hypponen erzaehlt aus dem Naehkaestchen:As an example, Hypponen said he had recently spoken to a European aircraft maker that said it cleans the cockpits of its planes every week of malware designed for Android phones. The malware spread to the planes only because factory employees were charging their phones with the USB port in the cockpit.Da fuehlt man sich doch gleich viel sicherer! (Danke, Andre)
