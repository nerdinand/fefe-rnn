[l] Nochmal eine Story zum Gender Gap: Wenn Frauen in einen vormals von Maennern dominierten Beruf vordringen, sinkt der Lohn.Once women start doing a job, “It just doesn’t look like it’s as important to the bottom line or requires as much skill,” said Paula England, a sociology professor at New York University.[…]The study, which she conducted with Asaf Levanon, of the University of Haifa in Israel, and Paul Allison of the University of Pennsylvania, found that when women moved into occupations in large numbers, those jobs began paying less even after controlling for education, work experience, skills, race and geography.[…]“It’s not that women are always picking lesser things in terms of skill and importance,” Ms. England said. “It’s just that the employers are deciding to pay it less.”Und sie haben auch ein paar Zahlen aus verschiedenen Branchen, und erwaehnen sogar IT als Beispiel in die andere Richtung:Computer programming, for instance, used to be a relatively menial role done by women. But when male programmers began to outnumber female ones, the job began paying more and gained prestige.
