[l] OK, also die Hacker, die da die Angestelltendaten aus der US-Regierung rausgetragen haben, das waren Chinesen!1!! Weil, aeh, damit koennen alle gut leben, wenn das die Chinesen waren. Guckt euch mal an, was die so an Security ueberwinden mussten:At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which regulates nuclear facilities, information about crucial components was left on unsecured network drives, and the agency lost track of laptops with critical data.Computers at the I.R.S. allowed employees to use weak passwords like “password.” One report detailed 7,329 “potential vulnerabilities” because software patches had not been installed. Auditors at the Department of Education, which stores information from millions of student loan applicants, were able to connect “rogue” computers and hardware to the network without being noticed. And at the Securities and Exchange Commission, part of the network had no firewall or intrusion protection for months.Voellig klar, das koennen ueberhaupt nur die Chinesen gewesen sein!
