[l] Donald Trump gab im Jahre 2000 zu Protokoll, dass er ja Buch fuehrt, wer in seinen Hotels mit welcher weiblichen Begleitung uebernachtet.I happen to know that one U.S. senator leading the pack of attackers spent more than a few nights with his twenty-something girlfriend at a hotel I own. There's also a conservative columnist, married, who was particularly rough on Clinton in this regard. He also brought his girlfriend to my resorts for the weekend."Who might we be talking about here? "My lips are permanently sealed," Trump said when we called. Not even going to offer hints or any information about how he knows. But all these folks "are lucky it's me," and not someone less discreet, he opined.Ja, die Diskretion in Person, dieser Trump!
