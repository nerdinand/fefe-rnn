The next gathering for “Ordensbrothers” and guests is an “investiture” March 10 in Charleston, S.C.The society’s U.S. chapter launched in 1966 at the famous Bohemian Club in San Francisco, which is associated with the all-male Bohemian Grove — one of the most well-known secret societies in the country.BINGO!
