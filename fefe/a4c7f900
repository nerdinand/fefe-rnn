[l] Kurze Durchsage von James "Spontaner Spot-Alzheimer" Clapper:Clapper made clear he was only speaking figuratively when referring to Trump as a Russian asset.Öh… wie meinen? Da wollen wir doch alle sehen, was er da "figuratively" gesagt hat, oder? Hier ist es:"I think this past weekend is illustrative of what a great case officer Vladimir Putin is. He knows how to handle an asset, and that's what he's doing with the President," said James Clapper […]"You have to remember Putin's background. He's a KGB officer. That's what they do. They recruit assets," Clapper added. "And I think some of that experience and instincts of Putin has come into play here in his managing of a pretty important account for him."
