Money Quote:The officer claims he is part of one of 10 newly formed and highly secretive police special operations teams, each with 16 members.He claims the teams are coordinated to execute a list of targets: suspected drug users, dealers and criminals.The killings mostly take place at night, he says, with the officers hooded and dressed in all black. They set their watches, giving themselves one minute or two to extract target individuals from their houses and kill on the spot – swift, precise, no witnesses.He claims they then dump the bodies – in the next town or under a bridge – or they plaster masking tape around the head of the corpse and place a cardboard sign on the body that reads “drug lord” or “pusher”.“We put placards in order for the media, in order for those investigating [the] bodies to redirect their investigation,” he explains, leading them to think: “‘Why should I investigate this guy, he is a drug pusher, he is a rapist, never mind with that one, I will just investigate the others. It’s a good thing for him that happened to him.’”Und hey, lacht nicht, so funktioniert das bei uns ja auch. Man sagt "Migrationshintergrund" und schon hat niemand mehr Interesse an der Aufklaerung.
