[l] Wo kriegt so ein ISIS-Terrorist eigentlich seine Schusswaffen her?Nun, das haben sie in ihren Hochglanz-Magazin mal erklaert (Link geht zur Washington Post, nicht zum ISIS-Mag):In the most recent issue of Rumiyah, its glossy multilingual propaganda magazine, the Islamic State encouraged recruits in the United States to take advantage of laws that allow people to buy firearms without having to present identification or submit to background checks.Recruits should seek out gun shows and online sales in particular, said the write-up in the magazine, which was released Thursday.“The acquisition of firearms can be very simple depending on one’s geographical location,” the piece read. “In most U.S. states, anything from a single-shot shotgun all the way up to a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle can be purchased at showrooms or through online sales — by way of private dealers — with no background checks, and without requiring either an ID or a gun license.”
