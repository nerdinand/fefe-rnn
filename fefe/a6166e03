[l] Wenn man bei Tor mal ein bisschen naeher hinguckt, findet man sowas hier:Our experiments revealed that ten relays shared moduli, and 3,557 relays—most part of a research project—shared prime factors, allowing adversaries to reconstruct private keys. We further discovered 122 relays that used non-standard RSA exponents, presumably in an attempt to attack onion services. By simulating how onion services are positioned in Tor’s distributed hash table, we could identify four onion services that were likely targeted by these malicious relays.
