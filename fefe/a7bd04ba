[l] Das Weisse Haus erklaert, woran man Fake News erkennt:Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, encouraged Americans in a statement issued late Thursday to be “skeptical about anonymous allegations” after a string of recent news reports about the evolving focus of the special counsel’s investigation into Russia’s election interference and possible collusion with President Trump’s associates.“Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous ‘officials,’ particularly when they do not identify the country — let alone the branch or agency of government — with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated,” Mr. Rosenstein said in the statement.Mit anderen Worten: Glaubt nur News, bei denen der Whistleblower schon verhaftet wurde!1!! Und die glaubt besser auch nicht.
