[l] Das russische Aussenministerium hat einen wunderschoenen Aprilscherz gefahren."You have reached the Russian embassy, your call is very important to us. To arrange a call from a Russian diplomat to your political opponents, press one," the message posted on the ministryâ€™s official Facebook page says, playing first in Russian, then in English."To use the services of Russian hackers press two," it goes on."To request election interference, press three and wait until the next election campaign. Please note that all calls are recorded for quality improvement and training purposes."MUHAHAHAHA
