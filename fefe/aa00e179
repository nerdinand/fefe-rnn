[l] Feminismus-Update:"Unfortunately I donâ€™t accept any Indian male students for internships. We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I have many female friends in my group, so I think this attitude is something I cannot support," Prof Annette G. Beck-Sickinger at the Institute of Biochemistry at Leipzig University wrote in an email to an Indian student.Update: Es sieht so aus, als sei die E-Mail aus Empoerungsmaximierungsgruenden gekuerzt wiedergegeben worden. (Danke, Thomas)
