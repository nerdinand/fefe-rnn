[l] Im Vergleich zu den 22 Millionen E-Mails, die die Bush-Junta ueber die Jahre "verloren" hat, wirken Hillary und ihr Mailserver geradezu vorbildlich transparent.Clinton’s email habits look positively transparent when compared with the subpoena-dodging, email-hiding, private-server-using George W. Bush administration. Between 2003 and 2009, the Bush White House “lost” 22 million emails. This correspondence included millions of emails written during the darkest period in America’s recent history, when the Bush administration was ginning up support for what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq with false claims that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and, later, when it was firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons.
