[l] Das Hillary-Camp reagiert auf Trumps Wahlbetrug-Gerede:Hillary Clinton’s advisers are privately worried that Trump’s calls for his supporters to stand watch at polling places in cities such as Philadelphia for any hint of fraud will result in intimidation tactics that might threaten her supporters and suppress the votes of African Americans and other minorities.The Democratic nominee’s campaign is recruiting and training hundreds of lawyers to fan out across the country, protecting people’s right to vote and documenting any signs of foul play, according to several people with knowledge of the plans.Und die Behoerden sind wohl sehr besorgt, dass es am Wahltag zu Unruhen und Ausschreitungen kommen koennte.
