[l] Das Weisse Haus unter Trump hat anscheinend ein Whistleblowing-Problem:"Nearly a dozen" White House staffers have told Washington Post reporters that Trump was "demoralized" by press reports that showed a poor turnout for his inauguration and a much larger turnout for the Women's March the next day, and overruled his advisors and aides' advice to let it go â€” instead, he ordered press secretary Sean Spicer to tell a series of easily falsifiable lies to the media that misrepresented the turnout for the inauguration.Das kann ja heiter werden. Entweder Trump stoesst jetzt eine Hexenjagd an oder das wird die transparenteste Regierung aller Zeiten :-) (Danke, Magnus)
