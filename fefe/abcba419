[l] Ein 78jaehriger CIA-Offizier im Ruhestand hat auf dem Todesbett gestanden, Marilyn Monroe fuer die CIA ermordet zu haben.“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy, but also with Fidel Castro. My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die, and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders … I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”WTF?!Update: Oooooch, das hat ja keine fuenf Minuten gehalten bei Boingboing. So wird das nichts mit dem Medienkompetenztraining! (Danke, Rop)
