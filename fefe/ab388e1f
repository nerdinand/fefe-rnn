[l] John McAfee ist verhaftet worden. Er war high auf Xanax und hatte eine Schusswaffe dabei. Money Quote:The shootout with the police was highly exaggerated and in fact no one was even hit by a bullet, let alone harmed by one. The Police knew me and I don’t believe their hearts were truly in the shootout, as it is not included in the official report. When I ran out of ammunition, I surrendered quietly and the officers and my self had a cigarette together and joked about my bad aim.Und weiter unten:At the sound of gunshots I naturally assumed that my ex wife had caught up with me and returned fire. Who wouldn’t. The only casualty was a 50 mph speed limit sign that0 intervened between myself and my presumed ex wife. I can’t shoot for shit on Xanax.Also lustig ist er ja.
