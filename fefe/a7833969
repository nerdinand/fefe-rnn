[l] Der Guardian hat einen schoenen WIR-WERDEN-ALLE-STÖRBEN-Artikel ueber Palantir. Money Quote:Palantir’s defence systems include advanced biometrics and walls impenetrable to radio waves, phone signal or internet. Its data storage is blockchained: it cannot be accessed by merely sophisticated hacking, it requires digital pass codes held by dozens of independent parties, whose identities are themselves protected by blockchain.OH NEIN! NICHT DIE BLOCKCHAIN! (Danke, Lukas)
