[l] New York fuehrt wieder Rassentrennung an den Schulen ein.An elite Manhattan school is teaching white students as young as 6 that they’re born racist and should feel guilty benefiting from “white privilege,” while heaping praise and cupcakes on their black peers.[…][The parents] complain the K-8 school of 430 kids is separating whites in classes where they’re made to feel awful about their “whiteness,” and all the “kids of color” in other rooms where they’re taught to feel proud about their race and are rewarded with treats and other privileges.Das ist aber schon OK so, denn diesmal diskriminieren wir unschuldige Kinder der anderen Rasse!1!!
