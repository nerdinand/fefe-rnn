[l] Richard "GNU/" Stallman im Guardian ueber Datenschutz.The surveillance imposed on us today far exceeds that of the Soviet Union. For freedom and democracy’s sake, we need to eliminate most of it. There are so many ways to use data to hurt people that the only safe database is the one that was never collected.Er schlaegt daher vor, unnoetige Datenerhebung auch mit User-Zustimmung zu verbieten.The GDPR makes much of requiring users (in some cases) to give consent for the collection of their data, but that doesn’t do much good. System designers have become expert at manufacturing consent (to repurpose Noam Chomsky’s phrase).Er hat voellig Recht.
