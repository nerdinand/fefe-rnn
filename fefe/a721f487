[l] Lacher am Rande fuer die Ökonomen unter euch:In the Fox interview, Trump also gave a convoluted answer about economic policy, when trying to connect the surge in the stock market since his election to the growing federal debt, which recently eclipsed $20 trillion.“The country — we took it over and owed over $20 trillion," Trump said. "As you know, the last eight years, they borrowed more than it did in the whole history of our country. So they borrowed more than $10 trillion, right? And yet, we picked up $5.2 trillion just in the stock market. … So you could say, in one sense, we're really increasing values. And maybe in a sense we're reducing debt. But we're very honored by it. And we're very, very happy.”Das ist so ein Schenkelklopfer, dass die Washington Post sich genoetigt sieht, das lieber nochmal explizit zu erklaeren:The stock market and federal debt levels are not connected.LMAOErinnert ihr euch, wie sie sagten, der Trump ist Geschaeftsmann, der kennt sich mit Wirtschaft aus? *gacker*
