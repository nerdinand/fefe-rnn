[l] Das US-Aussenministerium ist veraergert. Warum, fragt ihr? Darum:The United States takes offense at comments by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new communications director accusing President Barack Obama of anti-Semitism and suggesting that Secretary of State John Kerry had the mental abilities of a 12-year-old, the State Department said on Thursday.Der ist wohl schon haeufiger aufgefallen.Baratz, 42, has also taken jabs at the US secretary of state, John Kerry, saying he should seek out a job as a standup comedian, insinuating his speeches are laughable.In a 2004 column, Baratz, who lives in a West Bank settlement, voiced support for extremists pushing for a greater Jewish presence at a Jerusalem holy site.
