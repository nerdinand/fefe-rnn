[l] Wisst ihr, was passiert, wenn man so Bullshit wie "CSI Cyber" im Fernsehen laufen hat? Sowas hier:"The iPhone is a county owned telephone that may have connected to the San Bernardino County computer network. The seized iPhone may contain evidence that can only be found on the seized phone that it was used as a weapon to introduce a lying dormant cyber pathogen that endangers San Bernardino's infrastructure," according to a court filing (PDF) by Michael Ramos, the San Bernardino County district attorney.Un-fucking-believable.
