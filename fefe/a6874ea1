[l] Neulich auf MSNBC:On Thursday night, MSNBC’s signal abruptly froze during a broadcast of Hardball with Chris Matthews and repeated the word “Russia” over and over.Aber macht euch keine Sorgen, das ist ja bloss ein Einzelfall.On Thursday, C-SPAN’s broadcast of proceedings in the U.S. House of Representatives got bumped off the air during an anti-Trump speech by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA). C-SPAN’s signal was replaced by approximately 10 minutes of programming from Russia TodayNa gut, ZWEI Einzelfaelle.Mediaite also said that on Thursday, “(T)he lights mysteriously went out during the confirmation hearing for Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) while he was being vetted by the Senate Intelligence Committee.”OK OK, DREI Einzelfaelle!1!! :-)
