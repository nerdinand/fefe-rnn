[l] Das Heroinproblem in den USA ist anscheinend, von der Öffentlichkeit weitgehend unbemerkt, richtig doll schlimm geworden.FATAL heroin overdoses in America have almost tripled in three years. More than 8,250 people a year now die from heroin. At the same time, roughly double that number are dying from prescription opioid painkillers, which are molecularly similar. Heroin has become the fallback dope when an addict can’t afford, or find, pills. Total overdose deaths, most often from pills and heroin, now surpass traffic fatalities.
