Hello Moritz,

Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that your business presents
a higher risk for us and therefore we will no longer be able to service
you. More specifically, we have seen a number of higher risk
transactions during our routine monitoring program and this has led to
the decision to close your account. Your pending funds will be fully
settled per your normal settlement instructions.

In order to give you the opportunity to take measures such as informing
your customers or looking for an alternative solution, the termination
of services will become effective as of 31 January 2017.

Please be sure to obtain any information that you might need from the
merchant dashboard within a week, as your account will be deactivated on
31 January 2017.

Please note our decision is final and a re-instatement of transaction
capabilities after 31 January 2017 is not possible.

Our apologies for any inconvenience.

Kind regards,
Ich habe den Eindruck, dass wir mal dringend ein von solchen Probleme freies Zahlsystem brauchen.Moritz schreibt noch, dass er nur drei (saubere) Transaktionen gesehen hat auf dem Account, und von keinen riskanten Sachen weiss.
