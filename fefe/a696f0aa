[l] Matt Taibbi im Rolling Stone ueber die Russen-Geschichte. Mit diesem wunderschoenen Vergleich:This dramatic story puts the news media in a jackpot. Absent independent verification, reporters will have to rely upon the secret assessments of intelligence agencies to cover the story at all.Many reporters I know are quietly freaking out about having to go through that again. We all remember the WMD fiasco.Hat also doch jemand was davon gelernt! Gut!
