[l] Eine US-Richterin hat entschieden, dass der Abschuss einer Drohne ueber dem eigenen Grundstueck gerechtfertigt ist.During Monday's hearing, Boggs testified that flight data showed the drone was flying higher than Meredith stated. But Judge Rebecca Ward says that since at least two witnesses could see the drone below the tree line, it was an invasion of privacy."He had a right to shoot at this drone, and I'm gonna dismiss this charge," said Ward.
