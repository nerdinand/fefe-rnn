[l] In Grossbritannien gibt es einen Nachrichtendienst, der sich an Schulen und insbesondere die Kinder dort richtet. Selbstdarstellung:We launched The Day for schools and colleges to help explain current affairs in short articles written and illustrated with great care by our own staff writers and graphic artists; to be a serious briefing service for everyone, not just the people at the top of the pyramid; to help replace the conversation many do not have at home; to pick out the underlying issues that are shaping the world; and to help readers ask good questions rather than believe they have the answers.Our mission is to help students think about what they can see and hear around them in the news day by dayKlingt super, nicht wahr?Laut nervigem JS-Popup haben die ein Drittel der Schulen schon gewinnen koennen.Und so sieht das in der Praxis aus. (Danke, Sabine)
