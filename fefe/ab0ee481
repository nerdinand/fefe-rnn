[l] Deutschland und Schweden sind laut New York Times direkt in die "Kill Decisions" in Afghanistan involviert. Konkret laeuft das so ab:Decision-making for lethal Afghan strikes takes place in a room in the coalition headquarters in Kabul known as the Combined Joint Operations Center, or C.J.O.C. There, videoscreens monitor the targeting of people identified as enemies who fall within the United States military’s authority to conduct counterterrorism strikes, and are supposed to keep civilians from being hit.“They go around the table and say, ‘If you see any women or children, raise your hand,’ and that includes German and Swedish officers who are not supposed to be involved in counterterrorism,” said one of the senior officials, who has direct knowledge of the operation but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the targeting process. “A lot of NATO officials are pretty upset about it.”The other senior official, who similarly spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: “This is the last thing NATO wanted to be involved in, but the Americans seemed to want everyone in on it. I guess they felt it gave them political cover.”Nicht nur Cover, sondern auch gegenseitiges Kompromat. Das schweisst soziale Gruppierungen zusammen. Wir hatten das ja auch schon mal in Alternativlos besprochen, wie dieser Mechanismus funktioniert.“They were sitting around there giving thumbs up or down, like gladiators in a stadium,” the second official said. “While it was meant to be a protection against civilian casualties, it made some of them very uncomfortable, particularly the Germans.”JA WIESO MACHEN WIR DENN DANN DA MIT?! (Danke, Walter)
