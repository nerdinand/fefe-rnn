[l] Kurze Durchsage des Premierministers von Singapur:The last programme I wrote was a Sudoku solver in C++ several years ago, so I’m out of date.

It said “Haskell – learn you a Haskell for great good”, and one day that will be my retirement reading.o_OUpdate: Meanwhile in the EU: … Oettinger hat erfolgreich eine Kalender-Anwendung aufgerufen!1!! m( (Danke, Christoph)
