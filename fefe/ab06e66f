[l] Es gibt jetzt eine recht umfassende akademische Untersuchung der Frage, wer die Scharfschuetzen auf dem Maidan-Platz kontrolliert hat. Das Paper kommt von Ivan Katchanovski an der Uni Ottawa, und es wurde beim Jahrestreffen des Verbandes der Amerikanischen Politikwissenschaftler in San Francisco vorgestellt.Ich zitiere mal das Ergebnis, zu dem sie kommen:This academic investigation concludes that the massacre was a false flag operation, which was rationally planned and carried out with a goal of the overthrow of the government and seizure of power. It found various evidence of the involvement of an alliance of the far right organizations, specifically the Right Sector and Svoboda, and oligarchic parties, such as Fatherland. Concealed shooters and spotters were located in at least 20 Maidan-controlled buildings or areas. The various evidence that the protesters were killed from these locations include some 70 testimonies, primarily by Maidan protesters, several
videos of “snipers” targeting protesters from these buildings, comparisons of positions of the specific protesters at the time of their killing and their entry wounds, and bullet impact signs. The study uncovered  various videos and photos of armed Maidan “snipers” and spotters in many of these buildings.Wer sich jetzt denkt, Ivan Katchanovski, das ist bestimmt ein U-Boot der Russen, dessen Erkenntnisse koennen wir mal direkt ignorieren, fuer den will ich mal aus der Vita von dem Mann zitieren:Ivan Katchanovski teaches at the School of Political Studies and the Department of Communication at the University of Ottawa.
