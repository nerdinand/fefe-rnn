[l] Kurze Durchsage der Polizei von Miami:The fact that North Miami Beach police honed their aim by shooting a gallery of black men is no reflection on police-community relations in the city, said Maj. Kathy Katerman.“We have other targets, too,” she said. “We don’t just shoot at black males.”She said the photo gallery should have been disposed of before North Miami Beach cops left the range and Sgt. Deant’s group — she’s with the Florida Army National Guard — came in.Na dann ist ja alles gut! (Danke, Eric)
