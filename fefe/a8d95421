[l] Kennt ihr den schon? Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly asserted that Adolf Hitler had no intention of exterminating Europe’s Jews until a Palestinian persuaded him to do it.Wait, what?! Alter Schwede, also die im Nahen Osten haben ja immer noch die besten Verschwoerungstheorien.Hach naja, bestimmt eine Fringe-Site der Palaestinenser, die sind ja eh total verstrahlt und verzweifelt, die luegen sich da bestimmt einen zurecht.Denkt ihr euch das gerade?Dann vielleicht lieber die Primaerquelle von pmo.gov.il (pmo = prime minister's office):And this attack and other attacks on the Jewish community in 1920, 1921, 1929, were instigated by a call of the Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini, who was later sought for war crimes in the Nuremberg trials because he had a central role in fomenting the final solution. He flew to Berlin. Hitler didn’t want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to expel the Jews. And Haj Amin al-Husseini went to Hitler and said, "If you expel them, they'll all come here." "So what should I do with them?" he asked. He said, "Burn them." And he was sought in, during the Nuremberg trials for prosecution. He escaped it and later died of cancer, after the war, died of cancer in Cairo. But this is what Haj Amin al-Husseini said. He said, "The Jews seek to destroy the Temple Mount." My grandfather in 1920 seeks to destroy…? Sorry, the al-Aqsa Mosque.So this lie is about a hundred years old. It fomented many, many attacks. The Temple Mount stands. The al-Aqsa Mosque stands. But the lie stands too, persists.Krasse Kacke, ey. (Danke, Magnus und Rop)
