[l] Was passiert eigentlich, wenn ein paar Fundi-Moslems an einer Uni fuer sich einen Safe Space reklamieren und dann einen eingeladenen Vortrag einer feministischen Ex-Muslima per "No Platforming" verhindern? Das hier:Protesters from the Goldsmiths University Islamic Society have heckled and aggressively disrupted a talk from ex-Muslim and feminist campaigner Maryam Namazie.Ms Namazie was giving a speech on blasphemy and apostasy at the invitation of the Atheist, Secularist and Humanist Society at Goldsmiths University when several men from the Goldsmiths Islamic Society (ISOC) arrived and started disrupting the event.[…]The Islamic Society claimed that Namazie's attendance on campus was a violation of their "safe space".[…]Incredibly, the Goldsmiths Feminist Society sided with the Islamist protesters. They released a statement on 2 December expressing their "solidarity with Goldsmiths Islamic Society".They said: "We support them in condemning the actions of the Atheist, Secularist and Humanist Society and agree that hosting known islamophobes [sic] at our university creates a climate of hatred."
