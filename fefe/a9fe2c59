[l] Kennt ihr den schon?Westerwelle is a pro-Atlantic and friendly to the United States. He welcomed President Obama's Prague arms control initiative, but wishes to push the pace. As a first step he would ask the US to remove all tactical nuclear weapons from German territory. This is a sensitive issue for the FRG, because the presence of these American weapons gives Germany a seat at the nuclear planning table in NATO. Merkel will not support this idea.Ach SO ist das!
