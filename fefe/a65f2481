[l] Die Dienste fangen mit ihrem Widerstand gegen Trump an.In light of this, and out of worries about the White House’s ability to keep secrets, some of our spy agencies have begun withholding intelligence from the Oval Office. Why risk your most sensitive information if the president may ignore it anyway? A senior National Security Agency official explained that NSA was systematically holding back some of the “good stuff” from the White House, in an unprecedented move. For decades, NSA has prepared special reports for the president’s eyes only, containing enormously sensitive intelligence. In the last three weeks, however, NSA has ceased doing this, fearing Trump and his staff cannot keep their best SIGINT secrets.Da wird sich Trump irgendwann fragen, wozu er dann die Dienste ueberhaupt noch braucht. Ob das eine schlaue Entscheidung war?
