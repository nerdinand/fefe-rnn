[l] Ecuador verkauft China Ölbohrrechte im Amazonas-Regenwald fuer 80 Mio Dollar. Und das Stueck, um das es hier geht, ist wohl der letzte naturbelassene Regenwald in Ecuador.“That’s essentially the only Amazon in Ecuador that hasn’t been devastated by oil operations,” said Adam Zuckerman, environmental and human rights campaigner at the Oakland-based nonprofit Amazon Watch.“The whole northern Amazon has the legacy of Texaco, now owned by Chevron. Andes Petroleum, which is operating in the south, already operated in the north — and because of a legacy of contamination, and quite honestly, ethnocide in the north, the southern population sees this and says, ‘We don’t want this.’”
