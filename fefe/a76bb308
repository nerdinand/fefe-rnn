[l] Wie es zu Trumps Äusserungen zu Transgender im Militaer und den "Alt Left" kam: Der reagiert sehr stoerrisch, wenn ihm jemand sagt, was er zu tun hat. Er haelt sich fuer unfehlbar.The controversy over his response to the Charlottesville violence was no different. Agitated about being pressured by aides to clarify his first public statement, Trump unexpectedly unwound the damage control of the prior two days by assigning blame to the “alt-left” and calling some of the white supremacist protesters “very fine people.”Das hatte also nichts mit inhaltlichen Fragen zu tun.“In some ways, Trump would rather have people calling him racist than say he backed down the minute he was wrong,” one adviser to the White House said on Wednesday about Charlottesville. “This may turn into the biggest mess of his presidency because he is stubborn and doesn't realize how bad this is getting.”
